Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Project Submission: Behaviour Cloning

## Overview
This repository contains the code and report for a piece of coursework submitted for the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree. In this project, I train a convolutional neural network to control a car around in track in simulation.
